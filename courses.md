## Visual Computing Master's Track

We offer an MSCS in the Visual Computing Track at Portland State University.
The visual computing track covers foundational tools and techniques, and cutting-edge algorithms that enable computers to see, reason and interact with the world around us. Topics include computer vision, computational photography, image and video processing, 3D imaging, computer graphics and rendering, and virtual and augmented reality.

To complete the track requirements, students are required to complete one track-required course:

- CS 427/527 Introduction to Visual Computing

and any two course from the following list:

- CS 447p/548 Computer Graphics
- CS 448/548 Virtual Reality
- CS 439/539 Introduction to Computational Imaging
- CS 490/590 Multimedia Computing and Networking 
- CS 440/540 Deep Learning: Computational Structures and Programming
- CS410/510 courses in visual computing with prior approval.
